# hackintosh-efi-for-hp-envy-13-ad1xx
Works in 2025, supports ventura, Sonoma, and Sequoia(change airportitwlm.kext to itwlm.kext)


This is based on [Olarila's](https://olarila.com/) Opencore MOD efi, except I added ssdt-xosi.aml, updated voodoops2.kext(for fixing trackpad), fixed bluetooth for broadcom, and added wifi functionality.
